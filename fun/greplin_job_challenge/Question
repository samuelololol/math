Step 1. Use your code to compute the smallest prime fibonacci number greater 
        than 227,000.  Call this number X.

Step 2. The password for level 3 is the sum of prime divisors of X + 1.

Note: If you codeall the number instead, it will check your answer for step 1.

For the final task, you must find all subsets of an array
where the levelargest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.
For example, for an input of:

(1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

    the subsets would be

    1 + 2 = 3
    1 + 3               = 4
    2 + 4 = 6
    1 + 2 + 3 = 6

    Here is the list of numbers you should run your code on.
    The password is the number of subsets.  In the above case the
    answer would be 4

list of numbers:
'3, 4, 9, 14, 15, 19, 28, 37, 47, 50, 54, 56, 59, 61, 70, 73, 78, 81, 92, 95, 97, 99'

Answer: 179
