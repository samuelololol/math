# RBTree
Red-Black tree is a balanced binary search tree with a good bigO in its worst case

## Concepts

Red-Black tree is a binary search tree with following properties

* Every node is either red or `black`
* Every leaf node (nil) is `black`
* If a node is red, then both of its children are `black`
* All paths from a node to its decendant leaves contains the same number of `black` nodes.
* The root node is `black`
